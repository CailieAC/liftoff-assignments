## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Garden Planning web app will help users plan out their dream garden by providing information about a variety of plants. Users can check out what their chosen plants need to thrive, including water and sunlight needs, and figure out what and how many plants they have space for by checking space requirements. Users will also be able to keep track of planting and harvesting times in their calendar or task list. This project will also include a social aspect with users being able to share and see what they and others are planting and where.
